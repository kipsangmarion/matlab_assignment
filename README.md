# MATLAB Script: Spreadsheet Data to Individual Record Forms

This MATLAB script allows you to extract data from a spreadsheet with test scores, assign grades to the test scores and print individual student transcripts with all their results.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following:

- MATLAB installed on your system ([Download MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/))
- Spreadsheet file containing the data in a compatible format (e.g., .xlsx, .csv)

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your system and have the necessary spreadsheet file available.

2. Clone or download the MATLAB script file from the repository.

3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

4. Modify the script to match your specific requirements (see Configuration section below).

5. Run the script by typing its name in the MATLAB command window or clicking the "Run" button.

6. The script will read the data from the spreadsheet file, process it, and generate individual transcripts.

7. The generated transcripts can be saved in a specified directory as separate files (PDF or other supported format).

## Configuration

Before running the script, you may need to modify the following variables in the script according to your needs:

- Specify the path and filename of your spreadsheet file.
- Customize the transcript according to your desired layout.

Please ensure that you have the necessary read and write permissions for the specified directories and files.

## Supported Spreadsheet Formats

This script supports various spreadsheet formats, such as:

- Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)
- Comma-separated values (.csv)
- Tab-delimited text (.txt)

If you encounter any issues with the supported formats, please check the MATLAB documentation for further guidance.

## Notes

- This script assumes that the spreadsheet data is organized in a tabular format, with column headers representing different fields.

- The form template should be designed using MATLAB's printing capabilities, such as `figure`, `axes`, and text formatting functions. You can modify the template code to match your desired form layout and style.

- Additional MATLAB toolboxes or functions may be required depending on your specific customization needs.

Feel free to customize the script and form template according to your specific requirements.
